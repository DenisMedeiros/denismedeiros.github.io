This is just a set of exercises about Digital Image Processing solved 
using OpenCV library.

== Exercise 1: Negative of region

In this exercise, the purpose of the program is to receive two points stem:[P_1] and stem:[P_2] that
defines the opposite vertices of a rectangle inside the picture, and then calculate the negative of that region.

Its source code is bellow:

== Exercise 2: Replace the four quadrants

The program developed here has...

== Exercise 3: Counting bubbles

The program developed here has...
